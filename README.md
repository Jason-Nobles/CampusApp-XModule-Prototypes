Created XModule prototype for improving my university's mobile app with the Modo Labs Platform. Modules created using Node.js and integrated mock json data and API's for demonstration and functionality. Hosted using AWS lambda servers and local machine ngrok server technologies.

The StudentDashboard implements many student resources into one module, containing multiple pages.
