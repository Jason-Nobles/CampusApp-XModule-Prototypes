Created XModule prototype for improving my university's mobile app with the Modo Labs Platform. Modules created using Node.js, integrated mock json, mock yaml authentication data, and API's for demonstration and functionality. Hosted using AWS serverless and local machine ngrok server.

The StudentDashboard implements authentication while containing many student resources into one module, including multiple pages.
